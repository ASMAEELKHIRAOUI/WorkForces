## Global view on spring

- **IOC (Inversion Of Control):** Springâ€™s IOC container manages the lifecycle of java objects.
- **DI (Dependency Injection):** Spring supports dependency injection, allowing to inject object dependencies into classes.
- **Beans:** are the objects that are managed by the Spring container, they can be of various scopes, such as:
    - **Singleton:** one instance is created for the entire app context.
    - **Prototype:** a new instance is created every time it is requested.
    - **Request:** a new instance is created for each HTTP request.
    - **Session:** a new instance is created for each user session.
    - **Global Session:** a new instance is created for each global session.
  IoC has a component called IoC container, it is responsible for managing the lifecycles of beans and their dependencies. Spring is an example of such a container.
Bean Definition: A bean is essentially an object or an instance of a class, but in the context of Spring, it is defined and managed by the Spring IoC container. Bean definitions are typically specified in XML configuration files, Java code, or using annotations.
- **AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming):** achieves its goals through the use of "aspects." An aspect is a module that encapsulates a concern and defines how it should be applied to various parts of the codebase. Aspects are typically implemented using special constructs like:
    - **Advice:** This is the actual code that is executed at specific points in the program, known as join points. There are different types of advice, including "before," "after," "around," and "after-throwing," which allow you to execute code before, after, or around the join point.
    - **Pointcut:** A pointcut is an expression that defines when and where the advice should be applied. It specifies the join points within the codebase where the advice should be triggered.
    - **Join Point:** A join point is a specific point in the execution of the program, such as method invocations, field access, or exception handling.
